# Introduction
Welcome to my Pro Clubs project. This project was made to create a detailed database of player statistics from the Pro Clubs Head website. The primary goal of this project is to gather, organize, and store player performance data, making it readily available for analysis and integration into my club's website. This project consists of web scraping, data processing, and database management.
